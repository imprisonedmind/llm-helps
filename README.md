LLM-Helps: Project-Agnostic Agent Guides

- Purpose: This repo holds opinionated AGENTS.md playbooks you can reuse across projects. They instruct your coding agent how to write code for these kinds of projects (Django, React/TS), not how to build any one specific app.

- How to use: Symlink the relevant AGENTS.md into a projectâ€™s root so the agent treats it as the top-level directive for that project.
